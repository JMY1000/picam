/**
 * Camera.
 * <p>
 * Creating a camera instance will automatically "open" it so that it is ready for taking pictures.
 * <p>
 * If an error occurs, or if you no longer need the camera instance, you should {@link #close()} it.
 * <p>
 * Using try-with-resources is recommended to make sure the camera instance is closed, for example:
 * <pre>
 * try (Camera camera = new Camera(config) {
 *     camera.takePicture(new FilePictureCaptureHandler("capture.jpg"));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * A closed camera can be reopened via {@link #open()} if you are attempting to recover from an error, otherwise simply
 * create a new camera instance.
 * <p>
 * While the camera is in use you must make sure to keep references to the camera and any {@link PictureCaptureHandler}
 * objects that you are using to prevent them from being garbage-collected. If you do not, a fatal crash may occur and
 * kill your application.
 * <p>
 * The underlying camera is a hardware resource and as such is fundamentally <strong>single-threaded</strong>. You must
 * <strong>not</strong> access the camera from multiple threads concurrently.
