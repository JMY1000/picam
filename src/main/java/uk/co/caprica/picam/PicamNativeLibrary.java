/**
 * Helper class to extract the bundled native library file and install it to a local directory.
 * <p>
 * You can use this class to install the native library to the system temporary directory (the native library will be
 * automatically deleted when your application exits) or to any other directory you may like to specify.
 * <p>
 * When installing to a specific directory, you have the option to keep or overwrite the existing file.
 * <p>
 * For example, the simplest case:
 * <pre>
 * PicamNativeLibrary.installTempLibrary();
 * </pre>
 * Installing to a specific directory:
 * <pre>
 * PicamNativeLibrary.installLibrary("/home/pi");
 * </pre>
